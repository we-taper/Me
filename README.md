# Me
This is Taper's personal website.

I am now a U.G. in SUSTech (formerly SUSTC) in mainland China. I
studied Computer Science in my freshman year. I converted to Physics
in my sophomore year. I love mathematics and physics. Specifically, I
love Abstract Algebra, L.D. Landau, and Statistical Physics.

## Why not use Github pages

I tried Github pages for a while, and find it quite hard to maintain
for a long time. So to follow the K.I.S.S. principle, I came up with
the idea of this.

I create this website out of a Github repository because:

  1. Every website essentially follows a tree-like hierarchy, unless
     one wants some interaction.
  2. Directory is one plain but perfect representation of any
     tree-like hierarchy.
  3. Git repository is unbelievably easy to manage.
