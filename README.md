# Me
This is Taper's personal website. My real name is Chen Hongxiang
(陈鸿翔).

I am now an undergrad in [SUSTech](http://www.sustc.edu.cn/en)
(formerly SUSTC) in mainland China.  I studied Computer Science in my
freshman year. I converted to Physics in my sophomore year. I love
mathematics and physics. Specifically, I love Abstract Algebra,
Topology, L.D. Landau, and Statistical Physics.

## Why not use Github pages

I tried Github pages for a while, and find it quite hard to maintain
for a long time. So to follow the K.I.S.S. principle, I came up with
the idea of this.

I create this website out of a Github repository because:

  1. Every personal website essentially follows a tree-like hierarchy, unless
     one wants some interaction.
  2. Directory is one plain but perfect representation of any
     tree-like hierarchy.
  3. Git repository is unbelievably easy to manage.
