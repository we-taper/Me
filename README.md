# Me

This is Taper's personal website for introduction to my research interests. My
name is **Chen** *Hongxiang* (陈鸿翔), and you may found me by nickname
Taper/we.taper/we-taper/etc. on various sites.

I am now an undergrad in [SUSTech](http://www.sustc.edu.cn/en)
(formerly SUSTC) in mainland China. I like physics and I really love to think as
a philosopher. I wonder in this world of complex phenomena, what kind of
mathematics is most powerful in dealing with them.

I studied Computer Science in my freshman year, which gave me more spirits than
actual skills (as I am gradually forgetting the Java language). But thanks for
my previous programmer experience, I love doing everything in computer now, ans
have a open mind to all new theories.

## My research interests

* Condensed Matter Theory  

    **Topological Insulators**: Why they exists? What is the connection between
    them? How to classify them?

* Topology  

    Topology is fascinating way to extract *characteristics* of
    homeomorphic/homotopic *classes of objects*. Can this idea be more useful in
    the study of complex system? Can it be used to study phases?

* Biophysics.

    The traditional study of Biology has been centred around experiments. Now we
    want Biology to be more *predictive*, more *quantitative*, be more under our
    control. How will this be done? Will *new physics/mathematics* arise out of
    this study?

    I am sorry that I have not been updated it since I changed to physics. I
    hope I will write new things, share more thoughts this year (2017).

## Why not use GitHub pages

I tried GitHub pages for a while, and find it quite hard to maintain
for a long time. So to follow the K.I.S.S. principle, I came up with
the idea of this site. This site has the advantage that:

1. Directory is one plain but direct representation of any
 tree-like hierarchy.
2. Git repository is unbelievably easy to manage.
